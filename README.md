## Results 
Most of my work was conducted by using Jupyter Notebook. I applied serveral technics to retrieve the lagitiude and lonagtude of the cities. One of the programs that where used was the API Weather Data to plot out weather temperture, location and best time to visit the cities or countries. We research over 500 cities worldwide to gather the data. Here is a list of locations before we decided to clean the data and show less cities and countries that do fit the companies desire. 



After gathering the informtion, we then clean the data by limited those that does not fix the needs and wants of the cusitmoers that best fit our best. After cleaning the data we neared our seacrch down to the four best cities we thought was wbe good and not just the weather, location, but the driving distance as well.
