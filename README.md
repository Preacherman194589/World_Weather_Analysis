## Overview of the Analysis 

PlanMyTrip App is an app that displays information about the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is an employee of PlanMyTrip company and is the head of Data Analysis in the user Analysis Department. I was asked to assist him in building an app that would help customers look for their ideal hotel worldwide.   

## Results 
Most of my work was conducted by using Jupyter Notebook. I applied several technics to retrieve the latitude and longitude of the cities. Our team used API Weather Data to plot weather temperature, location, and the ideal time to visit the cities or countries. We research over 500 cities worldwide to gather the data. Here is a map of locations we decided to clean from the data and show fewer cities and countries that would fit the company's desire.

After gathering the information and cleaning the data, we used Google API to help us develop a routing system. We decided to expand the app by not just looking at hotels and the weather within that location; we want to look at safe routes and sceneries near and around the hotels and lodges. Jack asked our team to choose four cities throughout the clean data, program a latitude and longitude based on location, and develop, map, and mark a route from start to end.

## Summary 

PlanMyTrip app poses a great help to those who are looking for the best vacation getaway spot. It's more than an app that deals with the best hotels and lodging areas worldwide; it also gages the weather, location, and distance of travel and gives you routes to better serve your need. I recommend you use the app and give feedback on what is needed and what needs to be approved.
